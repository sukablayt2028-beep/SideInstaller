## What it is

SideStore and LiveContainer are currently the best way to sideload on iOS. However, there's one big
problem: installing them requires a PC, which many people don't have. That's why I made SideInstaller,
a free and open-source iOS app that installs them directly on your iPhone, no PC required.

SideInstaller handles the entire setup process on-device. It takes care of the pairing, provisioning, and
installation steps that normally force you to plug into a computer and run desktop tools, all from a single
app running on the phone itself. Once it's done, you get a fully working SideStore and LiveContainer
setup ready to sideload your own apps.

The whole thing is built to be simple. There's no complicated configuration, no command line, and no need
to understand how any of the underlying machinery works. You just open the app, follow a few steps, and let
it do the rest. For anyone who's ever wanted to sideload but didn't own a Mac or PC, this removes the
biggest barrier to getting started.

And because it's open source, you don't have to take my word for any of it. The full code is available for
anyone to read, audit, or contribute to, so you can see exactly what's running on your device.

## Requirements

- An iPhone or iPad on iOS 27
- A Wi-Fi router or a hotspot connection
- Your Apple account credentials (not collected)


## How to use it

1. Connect a VPN app that tunnels to this device on `10.7.0.1` — **LocalDevVPN**, **ClashMi**, or any other.
   SideInstaller checks the loopback address, not which app provides it, so use whichever you prefer.
2. Open [the official install page](https://frizzlem.github.io/SideInstaller/) and install the app using any
   of the certificates.
3. Once it's installed, open it.
4. Log in with your Apple account credentials.
5. Tap **Install SideStore** or **Install SideStore + LiveContainer**.
6. Wait while your selection installs.
7. That's it. No PC and no extra steps required.

### If GitHub is blocked where you are

SideInstaller pulls the SideStore IPA from GitHub, and iOS runs only one VPN at a time — so a local-only
tunnel like LocalDevVPN leaves nothing to reach a blocked GitHub through. Two ways around it:

- **Use a VPN app that does both jobs**, exposing the `10.7.0.1` loopback *and* proxying your traffic
  (ClashMi, for example). Step 1 then covers the download too.
- **Bring your own IPA.** Download it anywhere — another device, a mirror, a desktop — then either:
  - pick **Custom .ipa** in the Install picker and tap **Import .ipa**, which opens the Files picker so
    you can choose the file wherever it is (iCloud Drive, a USB drive, Downloads); or
  - copy it into **Files › On My iPhone › SideInstaller** named `SideStore.ipa` (or
    `LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa`; add `-nightly` for the nightly channel), and SideInstaller picks it
    up on its own.

  Either way it installs that file instead of downloading anything, and appears under Settings ›
  Downloaded IPAs — delete it there to go back to downloading.

### Resign & Install (custom IPA)

If you imported an IPA (Custom .ipa), SideInstaller now shows a clear "Resign & Install" button in the
Install card. Use it to sign the imported IPA with your Apple ID (the app prompts for 2FA if needed) and
install it to a paired device. Typical flow:

1. Pair your iPhone in the Pairing tab (or run the one-click flow's Pair step) so the app can open a loopback
   tunnel and capture the device UDID.
2. Import the IPA via Install › Custom .ipa › Import .ipa (or place it in Files › On My iPhone › SideInstaller).
3. In Install, pick Custom and tap **Resign & Install**.
4. The app will sign (si_sign_ipa) and then upload the signed bundle to the device via installation_proxy.

Notes:

- Make sure the device is paired and a loopback VPN is active before starting.
- If Apple rejects signing due to "maximum number of certificates" you'll see a guide and can revoke old
  certs in the Certificates tab.
- Device registration failures (Apple error 8220) will be surfaced with the UDID so you can add the device
  manually if needed.

## Is SideInstaller safe?

SideInstaller is built with safety and privacy in mind. The app is fully local and open source, which means
anyone can inspect exactly what it does.

**Your Apple credentials never leave your device.** They're used locally, only to sign and install your
  apps, and are never transmitted, logged, or collected in any way.

**No server, no analytics, no account.** Nothing is collected and there's nothing to sign up for.

**Fully auditable.** Every line of it can be verified in the source code.

> [!WARNING]
> All of the above is true of **this** repository and the builds published from it. It is **not** a guarantee
> that applies to forks, re-signed IPAs, or copies you find elsewhere — those can be modified to steal the
> Apple ID you type into them. If you didn't get it from
> [frizzlem.github.io/SideInstaller](https://frizzlem.github.io/SideInstaller/), don't trust it with your
> credentials.
